- A button on each route: orders, patients should fetch data from a mock API

# Patients: https://api.mocki.io/v2/51597ef3
# Orders: https://api.mocki.io/v2/x

- The result should be displayed in a list / grid below the button
- List / grid must include at least 4 columns
- Patient list should have an "age" column, calculated by date of birth
- A button to "favorite" should appear on each item row
- Add a third route that shows the items the user added to their favorites list
  (item can't be duplicated in the favorites list, item should be marked that it's in the favorites list)
- In the favorites-list route - a button on each item should remove the item from the list
- Should use ngrx

- Bonus 1: The favorites list should be filterable by a form input that filters
  by firstName (patient) / orderName (order)
- Bonus 2: Please make it look nice
